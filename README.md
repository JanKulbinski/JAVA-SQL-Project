The aim and funcionality of database is described in Projekt.pdf


In 'SQL' directory you can find srcipts, which are resposible for creating database (including tables, constrains, triggers, dynamic queries, transactions, access levels etc). GUI written in Java is located in 'DataBaseApp' directory.


Run GUI.jar to start application, don't forget to create first database using scripts in 'SQL' directory. To log in as a specific user use data from Employees table where you can find IDs and passwords.


NOTE: most of data to fill tables was imported from sakilla.db. To properly test application you should also download sakilla.db from https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-preface.html
